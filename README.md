# #6 CRUD with Controller, View and Model (MVC)

## Last time we created this page
<img src="/students_index.png" />      

## The Job today is to create these pages
### Create    
<img src="/create.png" />    

### Details (READ one student)    
<img src="/details.png" />    

### Update    
<img src="/update.png" />    

### Delete    
<img src="/delete.png" />    


This will involve:
* Html tags including the Form Tag
* Styling through CSS
  * In both the HTML and CSS case, you will learn through the **LTS method** _(Learning through stealing)_ 
* Sending data from the Controller by adding it to the "Model Object".
* Recieving and displaying data in the View using Thymeleaf.
* Sending data from the html page back to the Controller.
* Routing ```` GetMapping() and PostMapping() ````
