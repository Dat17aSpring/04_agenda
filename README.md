  * In both the HTML and CSS case, you will learn through the **LTS method** _(Learning through stealing)_ 
* Creating a **Student.java** class in the **Model layer** of the application
* Sending data from the **Controller** to the **View**, making use of the **Model** layer in our application (MVC).
