This will cover the "Read" functionallity of the CRUD operations.    

This will involve:

* Styling through CSS
  * In both the HTML and CSS case, you will learn through the **LTS method** _(Learning through stealing)_ 
* Creating a **Student.java** class in the **Model layer** of the application
* Sending data from the Controller by adding it to the "Model Object".
* Recieving and displaying data in the View using Thymeleaf.
* Getting a deeper understanding of the MVC architecture pattern
